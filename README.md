# Node.js - GraphQL

This project aims to show my knowledge about GraphQL. In this case, I'm using it with JavaScript.

This project has two important entities:

- **Users**
- **Profiles**

In this application, using these entities, it is possible to do complete CRUD with them. From reading to deleting this data. Using Mutations and other GraphQL structures
